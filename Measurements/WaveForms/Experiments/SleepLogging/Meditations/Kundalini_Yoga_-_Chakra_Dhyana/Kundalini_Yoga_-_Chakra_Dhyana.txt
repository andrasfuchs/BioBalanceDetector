Kundalini yoga is a physical and meditative discipline, comprising a set of simple techniques that uses the mind, senses and body to create a communication between "mind" and "body". Kundalini yoga focuses on psycho-spiritual growth and the body's potential for maturation, giving special consideration to the role of the spine and the endocrine system in the understanding of yogic awakening.

Kundalini Yoga concentrates on psychic energy centers (called "chakras") in the body in order to generate a spiritual power, which is known as kundalini energy.

Kundalini is the potential form of life force, lying dormant in our bodies. It is conceptualized as a coiled up serpent (literally, 'kundalini' in Sanskrit is 'That what is coiled'.) lying at the base of our spine, which can spring awake when activated by spiritual disciplines.

Included here is an introduction and step-by-step meditation exercise for initiation and accession of each chakra. Starting from Chakra 1 to 7, the student is required to meditate by following the simple instructions (preferably, use a head-phone) as described for each chakra.
